== Welcome

This project is to test ActiveAdmin with Nested Model Forms ala RailsCast 196 and 197.

I'm trying to answer these questions:

1.  In the form, I would like to use Formtastic's hidden but that fails

	form do |f|
		f.inputs "Survey" do
         		f.input :name
		end
	
		f.inputs "Courses" do		
			f.fields_for :questions do |qf|
				qf.hidden :_destroy
				qf.input :contents
				qf.input :position
			end
		end

		f.buttons
	end

But, it fails to render with the error:
undefined method `hidden' for #<ActiveAdmin::FormBuilder:0x007f8eb5494c88>

2.  In the same form, if I change fields_for block to

	qf.input :_destroy
	qf.input :contents

Only the contents field is displayed.  It seems that the input method is not appending correctly for the nested form?

3.  Is there a way to Ambre methods from the Form DSL?

If I add 

	div :id => 'blah'

before the f.buttons, the render fails with 
undefined method `div' for #<ActiveAdmin::DSL:0x007f8bc78e7128>
